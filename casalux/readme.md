This is a configuration for the Casalux 9W smart LED downligh as sold by Aldi in May 2025.

It is for the cool white - warm white version NOT the RGB.

To flash the CBLC5, solder a 3 pin header on the rear of the board, on the left side contacts.
From top to bottom is: T1 (Tx), R1 (Rx), RST (connect this to ground to enable flashing)
Solder the large connector on the bottom of this rear side (pint 6, 3.3V).
Ground can be used on the main PCB's header that connects to the LED board.
